## 📢 Introduction

This repository hosts the official resources for the technical report: **["Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? A Comprehensive Evaluation on 14 Tasks and 40 Datasets."](https://lowlevelbanana.github.io/assets_common/papers/LowLevelBananaEval_Report.pdf)**.

While commercial T2I models like **Nano Banana Pro** excel in creative synthesis, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: **Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder?** We conducted a comprehensive **zero-shot evaluation** across **14 distinct low-level tasks** spanning **40 diverse datasets**.

## 🔥 Key Highlights

- **Massive Benchmark:** Evaluated on **14** low-level vision tasks and **40** datasets.
- **Zero-Shot Setting:** Utilized simple textual prompts without any fine-tuning.
- **The Dichotomy Discovery:** We reveal a distinct performance dichotomy:
    - ✅ **Superior Subjective Quality:** Often hallucinates plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models.
    - ❌ **Lower Reference-Based Metrics:** Lags behind in PSNR/SSIM due to the inherent stochasticity of generative models.

## 💻 Evaluation Code
We will provide the complete evaluation code for the quantitative results of each task, which is currently being organized. Please stay tuned.


## 📊 Evaluation Results
*Detailed quantitative and qualitative comparisons can be found in our project page and full report.*

Our extensive analysis identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable **zero-shot contender** for low-level vision tasks. While it struggles to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics (PSNR/SSIM), it offers superior visual quality, suggesting a need for new perception-aligned evaluation paradigms.

We have released the evaluation datasets and corresponding inferred results of Nano Banana Pro used in our study on HuggingFace to facilitate future research.
